# ‚Åâ Why does this exist?
This initiative was started by [GoodGuysFree][GoodGuysFreeTwitter] shortly after the [No Man's Sky Aquarius update][nmsAquariusUpdate] added the fishing mechanic. [GoodGuysFree][GoodGuysFreeTwitter] started collecting and recording the in-game fishing information with some contributors such as PureCalamity, Lowe Gotembomrek and others. The results of which can be found [here][ggfGoogleSheet].

This work was very tedious and it turned out that the in-game data was not stored in an easy to data mine location in the game files. A collaboration was started with [Khaoz-Topsy][KhaozTopsyGithub] to integrate the data from the [Google Sheet][ggfGoogleSheet] into the web and mobile apps. At that time [ThatBomberBoi][ThatBomberBoiTwitter] stepped in and created a [NMS.py][nmspy] mod to extract the descriptions created by the game files when inserting a food item into the in-game Bait Box. From this extract we were able to extract the statistics and upload the data into the [GoogleSheet][ggfGoogleSheet] maintained by GoodGuysFree, PureCalamity, Lowe Gotembomrek and others.

This project is a collection of the files used to extract the data from the game files, parse the information and then upload the data to the [GoogleSheet][ggfGoogleSheet].
